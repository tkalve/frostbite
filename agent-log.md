# Frostbite Project Agent Log

This log documents the major prompts and requests from the user, and how each was solved by the agent, in chronological order.

---

## 1. Project Kickoff: Multiplayer Game "Frostbite"

**Prompt:**

- We want to make an online multi player game called frostbite. It will be a 3D game where your character can walk around, see other players, and throw snow balls at them. Each character should have some health indicator (body temp?), when it goes to zero the player is out, and has to wait an amount of time before respawning.

The frontend end/client should be in client folder. Start by making the app showing the 3D world the player can walk around in.

**Solution:**

- Chose Three.js for 3D frontend, Vite for dev server, and C# ASP.NET Core backend with SignalR for real-time multiplayer.
- Set up project structure: `/client` (frontend), `/backend/FrostbiteServer` (backend).
- Implemented 3D world, player movement, snowball throwing, and multiplayer sync via SignalR.

## 2. Temperature System: Celsius

**Prompt:**

- "Celsius, not Fahrenheit!"

**Solution:**

- Converted all temperature logic to Celsius (37°C healthy, 32°C frozen).
- Updated health calculations and UI to reflect Celsius values.

---

## 3. Backend API and CORS

**Prompt:**

- "In backend folder, I want the backend API. C# ASP.NET core project"

**Solution:**

- Created ASP.NET Core backend with SignalR hub (`GameHub`).
- Configured CORS to allow connections from localhost:3000, 3001, and variants.
- Ensured SignalR hub is accessible from frontend.

---

## 4. Multiplayer Integration

**Prompt:**

- Integrate frontend and backend for real-time multiplayer.

**Solution:**

- Implemented `NetworkManager.js` to handle SignalR events.
- Synced player positions, snowball throws, and health between clients.
- Fixed player count updates and ensured all clients see each other.

---

## 5. UI and Player Count

**Prompt:**

- "Player count does not update, fix it"

**Solution:**

- Updated backend to broadcast player count on connect/disconnect.
- Updated frontend to listen for and display real-time player count.

---

## 6. Dev Tweaks: No Temp Loss, Larger Players, Limited Spawn

**Prompt:**

- "Turn off body temp lowering. Also make the figures larger so we can see other players. Also, limit the area in which players spawn."

**Solution:**

- Disabled temperature loss in `Player.js`.
- Increased player mesh size in both local and remote player creation.
- Added random spawn within a 10x10 area.

---

## 7. Gamer Tags and Name Tags

**Prompt:**

- "When a player join, give them a random gamer tag. Player can see this in their UI, and it is shown over their head."

**Solution:**

- Backend generates random gamer tags (e.g., ArcticWolf42).
- Frontend displays gamer tag in UI and as a floating name tag above each player.
- Name tags always face the camera.

---

## 8. Unique Player Colors & Name Tag Position

**Prompt:**

- "Move the gamer tag a bit higher so it is not 'inside' the head, and assign each player a different color."

**Solution:**

- Name tags moved higher above player heads.
- Each player assigned a unique, bright color based on their ID.

---

## 9. First-Person Mesh Visibility

**Prompt:**

- "When I (as a player) move, my camera moves but my own rendition of my avatar does not move on my screen. Other players see my avatar move."

**Solution:**

- Hid the local player's own mesh in first-person view for standard FPS experience.

---

## 10. Docker Frontend for Production

**Prompt:**

- "The frontend needs a docker file to host build and serve it in nginx. u fix?"

**Solution:**

- Created a multi-stage Dockerfile for Vite build + Nginx serve.
- Added `nginx.conf`, `.dockerignore`, and `docker-compose.yml` for easy deployment.

---

## 11. Agent Log

**Prompt:**

- "Can you make an agent-log.md outlining my prompts and how you solved this? From the beginning."

**Solution:**

- Created this log summarizing all major requests and solutions.

**End of log.**
